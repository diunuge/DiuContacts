INSTALLATION

1. Create a MySQL database.

2. Use the file in the db folder to create the database structure (e.g. import it using a MySQL admin tool like phpMyAdmin)

3. Edit the connTCM.php file according to your server settings. The connTCM.php file is in the includes folder.

4. Upload all the files and folders to your server (Well, actually you don't need to upload the db folder). Make sure you keep the structure.

5. Enjoy!
